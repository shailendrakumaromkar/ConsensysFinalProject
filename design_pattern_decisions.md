## :bulb: Design Pattern

## Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern 
Validating the condition before performing any operation

## Fail early and fail loud
Modifiers are used to check for common requirements (e.g. onlyAdmin). This way, conditions are checked before the function body is executed, reducing unecessary code execution if the requirements are not met.

## Restricting Access
Correctly defining the access for state variables & function.
